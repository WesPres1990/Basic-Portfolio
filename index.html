        <p>Hello! I am a graduate of the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Economics from the Terry College of Business, 
            as well as a recent graduate of a full stack coding and web development course at Georgia Tech Professional Education in Savannah, GA.
        </p> 
            
        <p>At the moment, I consider myself proficient with HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap and therefore comfortable with creating static web pages; if you 
            tell me what needs to be created for a page and how it should look, I will in all likelihood be able to do it. Throughout the course, 
            I became more experienced with the use of JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, API's, MVC, React, and Handlebars and I am also familiar with Node.js, 
            NPM's, and MySQL and Mongo databases. In terms of version control, I have been using GitHub for everything I have done thus far.
        </p>
                
        <p>For most of my life, I have used Windows operating systems, though I have also used a Mac on occasion and look forward to gaining further 
            and more in-depth experience with it in the future as I continue to learn technologies and languages such as Ruby and Python.
        </p> 
                
        <p>Furthermore, I am skilled in customer service, research, writing, and economics, with extensive experience using Microsoft Office applications 
            and social media, while also possessing natural analytical abilities and an intellectually curious mind. I certainly look forward to continued 
            personal growth and development in this field.
        </p>
            
        <!-- <p>Originally seeking a career in finance or law, he has seen greater potential in coding and web development, and is now attending Georgia Tech’s Coding Bootcamp.
